#### **This is the proxy for RBX.BET**
We need this so that we can get around the cors issue with roblox.

### How to Install
1. If you want to host this on your own pc, download the git repository first.
2. While that is happening, download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. After you are done downloading node js, go inside the project, where all the files are and open your cmd there.
4. Run **npm install** in the project folder
5. Run **node server.js** in the project folder
6. Head to [RBX.BET](https://rbx.bet)
7. Press F12 and go to Application and find the Local Storage
8. Find the key that says proxy and change it to http://localhost:5000/ (you must include the / at the end)
9. That's all you need to do
